// Arkenfox Overrides

/* 0102: set startup page [SETUP-CHROME]
 * 0=blank, 1=home, 2=last visited page, 3=resume previous session
 * [NOTE] Session Restore is cleared with history (2811), and not used in Private Browsing mode
 * [SETTING] General>Startup>Restore previous session ***/
user_pref("browser.startup.page", 1);
/* 0103: set HOME+NEWWINDOW page
 * about:home=Firefox Home (default, see 0105), custom URL, about:blank
 * [SETTING] Home>New Windows and Tabs>Homepage and new windows ***/
user_pref("browser.startup.homepage", "about:newtab");
/* 0104: set NEWTAB page
 * true=Firefox Home (default, see 0105), false=blank page
 * [SETTING] Home>New Windows and Tabs>New tabs ***/
user_pref("browser.newtabpage.enabled", true);

/* 0801: disable location bar using search
 * Don't leak URL typos to a search engine, give an error message instead
 * Examples: "secretplace,com", "secretplace/com", "secretplace com", "secret place.com"
 * [NOTE] This does not affect explicit user action such as using search buttons in the
 * dropdown, or using keyword search shortcuts you configure in options (e.g. "d" for DuckDuckGo)
 * [SETUP-CHROME] Override this if you trust and use a privacy respecting search engine ***/
user_pref("keyword.enabled", true);

/* 1601: control when to send a cross-origin referer
 * 0=always (default), 1=only if base domains match, 2=only if hosts match
 * [SETUP-WEB] Breakage: older modems/routers and some sites e.g banks, vimeo, icloud, instagram
 * If "2" is too strict, then override to "0" and use Smart Referer extension (Strict mode + add exceptions) ***/
user_pref("network.http.referer.XOriginPolicy", 0);

/* 2022: disable all DRM content (EME: Encryption Media Extension)
 * Optionally hide the setting which also disables the DRM prompt
 * [SETUP-WEB] e.g. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, HBO, Disney+, Showtime, Starz, DirectTV
 * [SETTING] General>DRM Content>Play DRM-controlled content
 * [TEST] https://bitmovin.com/demos/drm
 * [1] https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/drms-dead-canary-how-we-just-lost-web-what-we-learned-it-and-what-we-need-do-next ***/
user_pref("media.eme.enabled", true);

/* 2620: enforce PDFJS, disable PDFJS scripting
 * This setting controls if the option "Display in Firefox" is available in the setting below
 *   and by effect controls whether PDFs are handled in-browser or externally ("Ask" or "Open With")
 * [WHY] pdfjs is lightweight, open source, and secure: the last exploit was June 2015 [1]
 *   It doesn't break "state separation" of browser content (by not sharing with OS, independent apps).
 *   It maintains disk avoidance and application data isolation. It's convenient. You can still save to disk.
 * [NOTE] JS can still force a pdf to open in-browser by bundling its own code
 * [SETUP-CHROME] You may prefer a different pdf reader for security/workflow reasons
 * [SETTING] General>Applications>Portable Document Format (PDF)
 * [1] https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=pdf.js+firefox ***/
// user_pref("pdfjs.disabled", false); // [DEFAULT: false]
user_pref("pdfjs.enableScripting", true); // [FF86+]

/* 4501: enable privacy.resistFingerprinting [FF41+]
 * [SETUP-WEB] RFP can cause some website breakage: mainly canvas, use a site exception via the urlbar
 * RFP also has a few side effects: mainly timezone is UTC0, and websites will prefer light theme
 * [1] https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/418986 ***/
user_pref("privacy.resistFingerprinting", false);

/* 4504: enable RFP letterboxing [FF67+]
 * Dynamically resizes the inner window by applying margins in stepped ranges [2]
 * If you use the dimension pref, then it will only apply those resolutions.
 * The format is "width1xheight1, width2xheight2, ..." (e.g. "800x600, 1000x1000")
 * [SETUP-WEB] This is independent of RFP (4501). If you're not using RFP, or you are but
 * dislike the margins, then flip this pref, keeping in mind that it is effectively fingerprintable
 * [WARNING] DO NOT USE: the dimension pref is only meant for testing
 * [1] https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/1407366
 * [2] https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/6d2d7856e468#l2.32 ***/
user_pref("privacy.resistFingerprinting.letterboxing", false); // [HIDDEN PREF]

/* 4520: disable WebGL (Web Graphics Library)
 * [SETUP-WEB] If you need it then override it. RFP still randomizes canvas for naive scripts ***/
user_pref("webgl.disabled", true);

/* 5003: disable saving passwords
 * [NOTE] This does not clear any passwords already saved
 * [SETTING] Privacy & Security>Logins and Passwords>Ask to save logins and passwords for websites ***/
user_pref("signon.rememberSignons", false);
